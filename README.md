Here's i use the machine learning technique called linear regression to predict the solubility of chemical compounds. It takes into account various characteristics of the compounds to make predictions. 
The working mechanism of the code is:
The code loads a dataset containing information about chemical compounds.
It separates the data into input features (characteristics of the compounds) and the target variable (solubility).
The data is then split into training and testing sets.
A linear regression model is built using the training data.
The model is used to predict solubility for both the training and testing sets.
The predicted solubility values can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

In summary, 
this code helps in predicting the solubility of chemical compounds based on their characteristics using a linear regression model.
